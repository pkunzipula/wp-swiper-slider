# wp-swiper-slider
Wordpress plugin that displays all posts in the 'Slider' category as a full-screen Swiper.js slideshow.

The Swiper.js slider works and looks awesome! I haven't seen it implemented for Wordpress. So I implemented it, in a very basic way that suits my own needs.

Right now, it displays a full-screen Swiper slider with all Posts in the 'Slider' category, ordered by Most Recent. It displays the full-size image, the Title, one paragraph of Content, and Thumbnails for the pagination bullets.

Eventually, for learning's sake, I may add admin options, like a Custom Slider Post Type with drag-n-drop reordering, category colors, text positioning, etc... but what I've got is perfect for what I'm trying to do. Maybe it will suit your needs too.

Check it out!
